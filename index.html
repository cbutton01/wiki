                <a
                  href="#">Multituberculata</a>, an extinct group of rodent-like mammals, on the basis of a single tooth, a low-<a href="#">crowned</a> molar. It is thought to have had a small body mass, about 70 g (2.5 oz), and may have eaten insects and plant
                  material. Its remains have been found in two <a href="#">geological formations</a> of present-day southern Argentina, as part of a mammal fauna that included the <a href="#">sudamericid Gondwanatherium</a> and a variety of <a href="#">dryolestoids</a>.
                  The upper and lower <a href="#">incisors</a> were long and rodent-like, with <a href="#">enamel</a> on only one side of the crown. A fragment of the lower jaw shows that the <a href="#">tooth socket</a> of the lower incisor was very
                  long. Although Ferugliotherium had much lower-crowned teeth than the sudamericids, they shared the same backward jaw movement during chewing and essentially similar patterns in their incisors and on the chewing surface of their molar-like
                  teeth, with small <a href="#">enamel prisms</a>. (<a href="#"><strong>Full article...</strong></a>)</p>
